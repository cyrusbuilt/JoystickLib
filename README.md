## Description

This is a library that provides an API foor reading one or more Joysticks
attached to an Arduino. This is a multi-instance library, so you can read
multiple joysticks. Only one analog pin is needed per axis. Most analog
joysticks are basically just (2) potentiometers that act as voltage dividers.
This library is based on the JoystickShield library (https://github.com/sudar/JoystickShield).
This library, however, does not process button events. It also does not
process joystick events separately. Events are fired immediately upon
detecting a state change (if, and only if, a state change *actually*
occurs).

## How to use

Copy the entire folder containing this library to the "libraries" folder
of your Arduino installation or sketchbook. Then include JoystickLib.h in
your sketch. See example below:

	#include "Arduino.h"
	#include "JoystickLib.h"

	// Create joystick instance attached to pins A0 (X-axis) and A1
	// Y-axis. This will also set the default threshold values.
	Joystick stick(A0, A1);

	void setup() {
		Serial.begin(9600);
		stick.calibrate();
	}

	void loop() {
		stick.loop();
		
		Serial.print("X = ");
		Serial.println(stick.getX());

		Serial.print("Y = ");
		Serial.println(stick.getY());

		delay(300);
	}
